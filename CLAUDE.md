# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is "Site-da-Tia-Rosa" (Aunt Rosa's Site), which appears to be a Portuguese website project. The repository is currently empty and ready for initial setup.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, the development environment and build system have not yet been established. Common patterns for web projects include:

- For static sites: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with tools like Webpack, Vite, or Parcel
- For React/Vue/Angular: Framework-specific CLI tools and build systems
- For Node.js: npm/yarn with package.json scripts
- For PHP: Composer for dependencies, possibly with build tools

## Commands

*Commands will be added once the project structure is established.*

## Architecture

*Architecture documentation will be added as the codebase develops.*

## Notes for Future Development

- This repository is currently empty and ready for initial project setup
- Consider the target audience (Portuguese-speaking users based on the project name)
- Determine the appropriate technology stack based on project requirements
- Set up proper development, build, and deployment workflows once the tech stack is chosen
